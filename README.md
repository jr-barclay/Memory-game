# Game Instructions
At the start of the game all cards are 'covered'.
You have to click/tap on a card to uncover it and find its's match.
A timer starts as you begin the game and the number of moves you make is recorded. You also start with three stars.
A move is one attempt to match a card. That is when two cards are uncovered.
The more moves you make, the less stars you have.
You win the game when all matches have been found.
At the end of the game your performance is displayed: The time it took to match all the cards, the number of moves made and the number of stars earned.
